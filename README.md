### Astrid
A relativistic ray tracing server and end-user application built on Astray.

### Next Steps
- Fix: Window: A metric change invalidates all parameters. When bounds are selected off, send empty AABB4 once.
- Implement: Keyboard + mouse interaction.
- Implement: Increment / decrement for position, rotation and bounds.
